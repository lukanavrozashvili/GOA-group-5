    <h2>CLOUD SERVICES</h2>
    <h3>Cloud services provide many ways for business team members to interact with the technology they need. The cloud
        is an internet-connected platform that can store and access information and programs. Since the cloud stores the
        information instead of holding it on a computer, team members can access and use it whether at home or in the
        office. Some cloud services can even run operation systems remotely, allowing team members to use internal
        business programs remotely without installing them on their computers.</h3>

    <h2>BACKUP SOLUTIONS</h2>
    <h3>Backup solutions protect information loss from occurring by storing copies of data on external hardware or
        online platforms, such as a cloud service. Information backup services can help protect your business'
        information should any issues occur, like a power outage or system failure. Many information backup services
        exist, such as file backup, server backup and even desktop backup. Businesses can schedule automatic backups for
        their files to save the most recent versions of the files they create to ensure data is secure.</h3>


    <h2>MONITORING</h2>
    <h3>IT services can monitor your network, internet traffic, computers and other internet-enabled devices. Monitoring
        allows IT teams to keep track of who accesses their businesses' information, whether any technology requires
        repairs and if any computers need software updates or modifications. Essentially, this IT service ensures that
        your team members have the tools and resources they need to complete their tasks.</h3>

    <h2>INFORMATION REPORTING</h2>
    <h3>Through their data collection and monitoring, IT services can provide reports on information about your
        organization. They can create reports on topics such as the use of technology and information storage to help
        you understand how effective your company's current services are. Many organizations' IT services provide
        software that helps streamline financial and project reporting. Information reporting services may also arrange
        information in a way that helps you better understand your business and make important decisions.</h3>
